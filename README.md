# 02 HTML and Advanced CSS : My-Portfolio

## Created from scratch and HTML document and styled with advanced CSS techniques

Below is a guide of how I built My Portfolio webpage. I'm an aspiring junior developer and my goal was to create a portfolio that provides an "about me" section, a "my work" section, and a "contact me" section.

1. Built the skeleton of the webpage using the index.html file.

2. Built out Header, then Main, and then Footer on index.html file.

3. Created a style.css file to contain my CSS styling code.

4. Linked style sheet to my index.html file.

5. Began with styling Header, and then Main, and then Footer

6. Placeholder application photos (sourced from ) were used because I I currently do not have any live applications I've developed.

7. Created working links so that the application photos are clickable and deploy in a new page. Placeholder of www.google.com was used because I currently do not have any live applications I've developed.

8. Added comments to help identify the what and why for specific elements and their corresponding styling in both the index.html file and the style.css file.

9. Finalized webpage by checking over code and reducing redunancies.
