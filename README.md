# 02 HTML and Advanced CSS : My-Portfolio

## Created from scratch and HTML document and styled with advanced CSS techniques

Below is a guide of how I built My Portfolio webpage. I'm an aspiring junior developer and my goal was to create a portfolio that provides an "about me" section, a "my work" section, and a "contact me" section.

- Built the skeleton of the webpage using the index.html file.

- Built out Header, then Main, and then Footer on index.html file.

- Created a style.css file to contain my CSS styling code.

- Linked style sheet to my index.html file.

- Began with styling Header, and then Main, and then Footer

- Placeholder application photos (sourced from ) were used because I I currently do not have any live applications I've developed.

- Created working links so that the application photos are clickable and deploy in a new page. Placeholder of www.google.com was used because I currently do not have any live applications I've developed.

- Added comments to help identify the what and why for specific elements and their corresponding styling in both the index.html file and the style.css file.

- Finalized webpage by checking over code and reducing redunancies.
